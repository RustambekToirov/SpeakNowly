Create a dynamic IELTS Reading test based on the following criteria:

Level: (level)
One of three levels: easy, medium, or hard.
Adjust the complexity of the passages and questions to match the selected level.
Structure:
The test must consist of three unique passages, each representing a different and distinctive theme or subject.
The total number of questions must be 40:
Passage 1: 13 questions.
Passage 2: 14 questions.
Passage 3: 13 questions.
Ensure a balanced mix of question types (MULTIPLE_CHOICE and TEXT) for each passage:
Each passage should include 50-70% multiple-choice questions and 30-50% free-text questions.
Skills:
Each passage should assess a specific reading skill, such as:
Skimming: Questions that focus on main ideas or primary purposes.
Scanning: Questions that require finding specific information in the passage.
Understanding Details: Questions about explicitly stated information.
Inference: Questions requiring logical conclusions based on the passage.
Include a skill field for each passage indicating the primary skill being tested.
Scoring:
Each question should have a score field specifying the points awarded for a correct answer.
MULTIPLE_CHOICE questions should typically be worth 1-2 points.
TEXT questions, which require more effort, should be worth 2-4 points depending on complexity.
Timing:
The entire test must be solvable within 60 minutes, with appropriately structured passages and questions.
Word Count for Passages:
Each passage must contain between 500 and 800 words.
The word count and complexity of the passages should align with the level (easy, medium, or hard).
Unique Themes:
Each passage must have a completely unique theme or subject that has not been used in previous tests.
Topics must reflect cultural diversity, current trends, or niche subjects while remaining suitable for IELTS Reading tests.
Examples of themes:
General: Topics such as "Eco-Tourism," "The Rise of Remote Work," or "Historical Landmarks."
Academic: Topics such as "The Evolution of Renewable Energy," "The Psychology of Learning," or "Breakthroughs in Genetic Engineering."
Format:
Each passage should include:
A number field (indicating the sequence, e.g., 1, 2, 3).
A skill field (e.g., "Skimming" or "Understanding Details").
A title for the passage.
The full passage text, with a word count between 500 and 800 words.
Each question should include:
A text field (the question text).
A type field indicating the question type:
TEXT (free-response).
MULTIPLE_CHOICE (multiple-choice questions).
A score field specifying the points for a correct answer.
For MULTIPLE_CHOICE questions, provide answers with a text field for each option and an is_correct flag.
Randomness and Balance:
Ensure a random mix of question types for each passage:
Passage 1: ~50% MULTIPLE_CHOICE, ~50% TEXT.
Passage 2: ~60% MULTIPLE_CHOICE, ~40% TEXT.
Passage 3: ~70% MULTIPLE_CHOICE, ~30% TEXT.
Randomize the order of questions within each passage while maintaining clarity.
Question Clarity:
Ensure all questions are clear, concise, and unambiguous.
Examples:
Skimming questions: “What is the primary purpose of the passage?”
Detail-based questions: “Which year is mentioned as a turning point for the subject discussed?”
Inference questions: “What can be inferred about the author’s perspective on the topic?”
