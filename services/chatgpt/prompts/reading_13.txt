Create two IELTS Reading passages based on the following criteria:

Level: (level)
One of three levels: easy, medium, or hard.
Adjust the complexity of the passages and questions to match the selected level.
Structure:
Generate exactly two unique passages, each with a different and distinctive theme or subject.
Each passage must have exactly 13 questions.
Ensure a balanced mix of question types (MULTIPLE_CHOICE and TEXT) for each passage:
Passage 1: ~50% MULTIPLE_CHOICE, ~50% TEXT.
Passage 2: ~70% MULTIPLE_CHOICE, ~30% TEXT.
Skills:
Each passage should assess a specific reading skill, such as:
Skimming: Questions that focus on main ideas or primary purposes.
Scanning: Questions that require finding specific information in the passage.
Understanding Details: Questions about explicitly stated information.
Inference: Questions requiring logical conclusions based on the passage.
Include a skill field for each passage indicating the primary skill being tested.
Scoring:
Each question should have a score field specifying the points awarded for a correct answer.
MULTIPLE_CHOICE questions should typically be worth 1-2 points.
TEXT questions, which require more effort, should be worth 2-4 points depending on complexity.
Timing:
Each passage must be solvable within 20 minutes.
Word Count for Passages:
Each passage must contain between 500 and 800 words.
Unique Themes:
Each passage must have a completely unique theme or subject.
Format:
Each passage should include:
A number field (1 or 3).
A skill field (e.g., "Skimming" or "Inference").
A title for the passage.
The full passage text, with a word count between 500 and 800 words.
Each question should include:
A text field (the question text).
A type field indicating the question type:
TEXT (free-response).
MULTIPLE_CHOICE (multiple-choice questions).
A score field specifying the points for a correct answer.
For MULTIPLE_CHOICE questions, provide answers with a text field for each option and an is_correct flag.
Randomness and Balance:
Randomize the order of questions within each passage while maintaining clarity.
Question Clarity:
Ensure all questions are clear, concise, and unambiguous.
Examples:
Skimming questions: “What is the primary purpose of the passage?”
Detail-based questions: “Which year is mentioned as a turning point for the subject discussed?”
Inference questions: “What can be inferred about the author’s perspective on the topic?”
